# What is the purpose of the economy?

Economist Herman Daly defines the purpose of the economy
as the mediator between ultimate means,
which come from the natural environment such as solar energy,
and ultimate ends,
such as happiness and fulfillment,
as depicted in Daly's Pyramid below [REF].
To deliver these ultimate ends,
the economy converts ultimate means
into intermediate means, 
such as built capital,
from which intermediate means,
such as social capital,
may be generated.

Daly further identifies three important questions
within the field of economics.
**Scale**, how large is the economy compared with the
social and environmental systems of which it is a subset?
**Distribution**, 
how should access to natural and economic resources be apportioned?
And finally **allocation**,
to what economic ends should resources be directed.
The market, as opposed to say central planning,
does a good job at allocating resources to desired ends.
However, the market can and should not 
be regarded in decisions related to scale and distribution.

Most governments regard growth of the economy as
a pancea for most (if not all) social ills,
however it must be realized that at a certain point 
(which may already have been reached!)
continued growth of the economic system 
at the expense of the natural environment
will ultimately make us less well off.
