# Ability to exhale carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a colorless gas, 
ocurring naturally in the atmosphere 
at around 0.4% or 412 parts per million (ppm).
Carbon dioxide has multiple industrial uses, including 
carbonated beverages such as sodas, beers, or sparkling wines;
an inert gas for welding or fire extinguishers;
and for reinjection in enhanced oil recovery.


## Carbon dioxide in the atmosphre
Current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is 410 ppm (around 0.4%). 
This level has fluctuated over most of Earth’s history 
and is closely tied with global temperatures [Foster2017].

Natural sources of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
come from the respiration within the biosphere
(both on land and in the oceans), 
through wild fires, 
through volcanic activity, 
and through human activities 
such as fossil fuel combustion 
and cement production.

In the absence of life, 
especially photosynthesis, 
the chemical composition of the atmosphere 
would tend toward chemical equilibrium,
as represented by high levels of carbon dioxide. 
Such is the case on Venus and Mars, 
which both have carbon dioxide levels of over 95%. Projections of anthropogenic climate change 
over the current century 
predict atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide 
between 420 ppm, 
in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 
and 935 ppm in RCP 8.5 [IPCC2014]

## Metabolism of carbon dioxide

In animal metabolism, 
carbon-hydrogen bonds 
are reduced using oxygen 
to produce water and carbon dioxide. 
The animal must have the ability 
to expel this carbon dioxide. 
If carbon dioxide is not expelled, 
the body can experience injury 
or even death. 
Since carbon dioxide 
bonds to blood cells 
in place of oxygen, 
it inhibits the body’s ability 
to absorb oxygen. 
Hypercapnia, 
oversaturation of carbon dioxide in the blood, 
lowers blood pH (acidosis) 
which can impede heart function.

In an extreme example, 
crew members in the Biosphere 2 experiment 
had to face carbon dioxide concentrations 
of over 4000 ppm, 
at which level, 
cognitive dysfunction can occur [REF].
