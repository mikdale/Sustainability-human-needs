# Motivation

This book is motivated by my teaching of an Environmental Sustainability class. 
I was constantly looking for ways to embed the environmental and sustainability issues
in the everyday experience of the students' lives.

The evidence is fairly clear that human activity 
is having a dramatic impact on the natural environment.
We are changing the climate on an unprecendet scale,
species are becoming extinct at apocalyptic rates,
we are alse disrupting many other natural cycles.

## Planetary boundaries

Two images tell this story most clearly for me.
The first shows the concept of **planetary boundaries**,
safe operating spaces for humanity
(classified as *safe*, *increasing risk*, and *high risk*)
across a variety of environmental concerns.
As can be seen in {numref}```fig-label:planetary```,
humans activities are at or beyond the safe operating space
for a number of these concerns, including
biospheric integrity due to total biodiversity loss (E/MSY) and
biogeochemical flows of both nitrogen and phosphorus,
experienced as eutrophication
ostencibly from runoff of synthetic fertilizers in industrial agriculture.

## Ecological footprint

The second image is shown in {numref}```fig-label:HDI_eco```.
