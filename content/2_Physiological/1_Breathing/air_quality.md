# Indoor air quality

In addition to oxygen and carbon dioxide, 
a number of other chemicals or pollutants 
can impact breathing. 
Within the non-industrialized world, 
wood is still often used within homes 
for both cooking and heating. 
Often wood is burned 
in an open fire without adequate ventilation. 
Wood smoke contains many harmful chemicals 
including carbon monoxide, 
benzene, 
formaldehyde, and 
particulates. 
Women and infants are most impacted, 
with respiratory infections 
being the second-highest (15%) 
cause of global child mortality.
