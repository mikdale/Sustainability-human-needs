# Breathing

As thermodynamic systems,
in order to maintain disequilibrium with their environments,
i.e. stay alive,
all living beings must respire.
That is, 
they must take in low entropy (high exergy) resources
and dispose of high entropy (low exergy) wastes.
How organisms obtain these resource inputs can roughly be accounted as:
carbon for synthesizing cell mass, either from
    carbon dioxide (autotrophic),
    organic compounds (heterotrophic), or
    both (mixotrophic);
reducing agents (e.g. hydrogen or electrons) for biosynthetic reactions, from
    inorganic compounds (lithotrophic), or
    organic compounds (organotrophic);
and energy for living and growing from
    light (phototrophic), or
    external chemical compounds (chemotrophic).

Earth's atmosphere has changed dramatically over its lifetime.
The earliest atmosphere would have retained many of the gases of the solar nebula
from which the planets were formed, including hydrogen and its anions.
Outgassing from volcanism of the volatile young planet
would have formed a second atmosphere consisting mainly of 
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other inert gases,
in a composition reflecting an atmospheres with little influence from 
living systems,
which until this time were mainly anearobic.

Starting around 2.5 billion years ago,
newly-evolved cyanobacteria drastically changed the atmospheric composition.
For plants,
water and carbon dioxide are taken in
and transformed through photosynthesis with light (normally sunlight)
into chemital fuel (hydrocarbons) and oxygen,
which is expelled.
Macronutrients, 
including nitrogen and phosphorus,
and micronutrients,
including iron and copper,
are combined with nitrogen to form amino acids and thereby proteins
and other metabolites that the plants need to function and grow.
This has been called the Great Oxygenation Event which had two main impacts:
1. oxygen reacted methane in the atmosphere to carbon dioxide, 
    a weaker greenhouse gas, causing planetary cooling;
2. the increase in atmospheric oxygen concentration caused the extinction of many (mainly anearobic) species,
    but also opened the opportunity for biological diversification, for example the evolution of mitachondria.

Since animals cannot produce glucose directly,
they must take it from the environment as food,
either from plants or other animals.
Oxygen is required to reduce this chemical fuel,
which animals take in from the environment.
During such respiration, carbon dioxide is produced,
which must be expelled from the body.

The hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen cycles are deeply intertwined through the plant and animal kingdoms.

As such, 
there is a deep connection between the plant and animal kingdoms.
If not for the presence of free oxygen in the atmosphere,
the hydrocarbon fuel is of little use.
This can be seen in space vehicles, 
which must carry both a fuel and an oxidizing agent.
