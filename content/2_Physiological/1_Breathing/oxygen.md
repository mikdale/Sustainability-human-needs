#  Oxygen

```{margin}
There are many living species that do not require oxygen, including anaer- obic bacteria. In fact, some researchers speculate that when the first cyanobacte- ria started photosynthesizing, their oxy- gen waste product caused a mass extinc- tion event in the other anaerobic bac- teria [Margulis1997]. As ‘the exception that proves the rule’, a metazoa (multi- cellular animal) has recently been found that lives it entire life in anoxic condi- tions [Danovaro2010]

All animals require oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to metabolize chemicals within the body. 
Different animals access oxygen within their environment in different ways. 
For example, many smaller animals, 
e.g. spiders, 
breath by exchanging gas through the surface of their body, 
which can work both above or below water. 
Larger spiders may have primitive lung structures. 
Crabs, fish, and other water-dwelling creatures 
have gills which allow them to pull oxygen from the water. 
Insects absorb oxygen in the atmosphere through openings in their exoskeleton called spiracles. 
The oxygen is then transported around their body through smaller ‘trachaea’ tubes. 
Land-dwelling animals, 
such as birds, replites, and mammals, 
breath air into lungs which then absorb the oxygen. 
Molluscs can have either lungs or gills. 
Amphibians have either lungs 
(e.g. frogs) 
or gills 
(e.g. salamanders), 
but can also absorb oxygen through their skin.

Within humans, oxygen is carried around the body through the blood stream. 
The major consumer of oxygen is the metabolically active brain, which takes up around 20% of oxygen within the body. 
If it doesn’t get what it needs, 
cells start dying, 
which can lead to permanent brain damage. 
The human body can survive a few minutes without oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). 
In an extreme example, 
six-year old Michelle Funk 
was submerged for over an hour in icy water 
but survived with full neurological functioning [Altman1988]. 
Free divers have held their breath for over twenty minutes 
with the world record, 
held by Aleix Segura Vendrell, 
being 24 minutes in 2016 [Guiness2016], 
though this was achieved through preparatory hyperventilation of pure oxygen before the attempt.

## Death zone

Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude. [XXXX - SIDE PLOT]
Therefore, at higher elevations, 
in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen, 
a person must inhale a proportionally greater volume of air. 
Physiological responses to chronic lack of oxygen 
among peoples who inhabit high-altitude areas can include 
increase in lung capacity [Diniz2014], 
increase in red blood cells that carry oxygen [Hurford1990], 
increase in cerebral blood flow [Moore1998], 
and increase in breath [REF]. 
An extreme example of lack of oxygen occurs in climbers above 8000m elevation in what is known as the ‘death zone’.

Everest's death zone covers an aread of around XXXX m<sup>2</sup>. [CHANGE THIS TO EMBEDDED MAP]
```

At this altitude, 
the human body cannot acclimatize and uses oxygen faster than it can be breathed in. 
Extended periods in the death zone result in 
shutting down of body functioning, 
loss of consciousness, 
and eventual death [Huey2001].
