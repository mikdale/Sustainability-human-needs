<h1 id="Sustainability-and-Human-Needs">Sustainability and Human Needs<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sustainability-and-Human-Needs"> </a></h1><p>This book is motivated by my teaching of an Environmental Sustainability class. 
I was constantly looking for ways to embed the environmental and sustainability issues
in the everyday experience of the students' lives.</p>
<p>The evidence is fairly clear that human activity 
is having a dramatic impact on the natural environment.
We are changing the climate on an unprecendet scale,
species are becoming extinct at apocalyptic rates,
we are alse disrupting many other natural cycles.</p>
<p>Two images tell this story most clearly for me.</p>
