<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction"> </a></h1><p>Human beings are physical beings subject to physical laws, 
most notably the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. 
Living beings must maintain themselves 
far from thermodynamic equilibrium with their surroundings.
In order to do so, 
they are open systems tied to their environments 
at both the front and back ends. 
On the input side, 
we must obtain high quality (high exergy or low entropy) resources 
from which we acquire energy to power our bodies and nutrients to
replace them.
This comes in the form of both food and oxygen.[^1]</p>
<!-- #region {"tags": ["popout"]} -->
**1**: As will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 on breathing, 
food and oxygen are essentially two sides of the same coin, 
both created in the act of photosynthesis. 
Without free oxygen in the atmosphere, we would be unable to consume (i.e. ‘burn’) food,
which are essentially hydrocarbons.
<!-- #endregion -->

<p>On the output side, 
we must get rid of low quality (low exergy or high entropy) wastes,
such as heat, urine, feces, and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>As living beings, 
we have fundamental needs that entail a certain amount of environmental impact. 
However, 
certain modes by which we choose to satisfy our fundamental needs 
entail greater environmental impacts. 
An obvious example here is the need to excrete feces, 
as met by the humble toilet. 
Within the Western world, 
we sit upon them, 
use paper to clean ourselves afterwards, 
and flush them using potable water. 
Afterwards we wash our hands 
(again with potable water) 
and then dry them with either cloth 
or paper towels 
or electric hand dryers. 
This is certainly not the standard around the globe 
and each of these choices implies greater or lesser environmental damage. 
The purpose of this book is an exploration of environmental impacts 
related to how we choose to satisfy our fundamental human needs.</p>
